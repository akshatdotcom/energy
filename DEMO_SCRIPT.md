## One-Sentence Description (for submission form)

> AeroCharge is an AI-powered EV fleet load management platform that prevents commercial facilities from exceeding utility demand thresholds by intelligently allocating power across chargers in real time — saving fleets tens of thousands of dollars per month in demand charges.

## Script

**[START on the landing page — `localhost:3001`]**

> "Fleet operators are getting crushed by demand charges. If charging spikes past a utility threshold, one depot can lose over $50,000 a month. AeroCharge prevents that in real time."

**[Point to the animated demand chart in the hero]**

> "This chart shows the risk: eight chargers at full speed can exceed the 500-kilowatt limit. Every kilowatt above that line becomes a penalty."

**[Click "Enter Demo Dashboard"]**

> "Our AI agent runs every five seconds. It reads base load, battery state, and departure deadlines, then allocates power to keep the site under limit while prioritizing the vehicles that need energy first."

**[Click "AI Insights" in the sidebar]**

> "The system is explainable. In AI Insights, operators can see anomalies and exactly why chargers were throttled, so there is clear operational traceability."

**[Click "Rebates" in the sidebar]**

> "We also surface financial upside: seven rebate programs, $154,000 identified, and $79,000 already claimed."

**[Click "Site View" in the sidebar — pause a moment for the 3D scene to load]**

> "This is the 3D depot view: live charger status and a headroom gauge so teams can instantly understand site risk."

**[Click "Reports" in the sidebar]**

> "Reports summarize outcomes: 90 days, 140,000 kilowatt-hours delivered, and $141,000 in demand charges avoided at one site."

**[Hold on the dashboard or landing page for the close]**

> "AeroCharge is live today with AI allocation, explainability, 3D visualization, rebate tracking, and reporting. We built it for fleet teams paying charges they should not have to pay. Thank you."
