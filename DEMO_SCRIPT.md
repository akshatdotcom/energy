## One-Sentence Description (for submission form)

> AeroCharge is an AI-powered EV fleet load management platform that prevents commercial facilities from exceeding utility demand thresholds by intelligently allocating power across chargers in real time — saving fleets tens of thousands of dollars per month in demand charges.

## Script

**[START on the landing page — `localhost:3001`]**

> "Every commercial fleet facility in the US is being silently taxed. When EV chargers spike power demand past a utility threshold, operators pay penalty fees that can exceed $50,000 a month. We built AeroCharge to eliminate that.

**[Point to the animated demand chart in the hero]**

> You can see the problem right here — eight chargers all charging at full rate would blow past this 500-kilowatt demand limit. Every kilowatt over that line is money burned.

**[Click "Enter Demo Dashboard"]**

> AeroCharge's AI agent runs every five seconds. It reads the building's base load, each vehicle's battery state, and exactly when every truck or van needs to leave — then allocates power to keep the entire site under its limit. Right now it's prioritizing Truck A07 because it has the most energy deficit, and protecting Van A03 because it leaves first at 7 AM.

**[Click "AI Insights" in the sidebar]**

> The AI doesn't just allocate — it explains itself. Here's the anomaly timeline: a GFCI fault caught on CH08 before it killed a session. And here's a full forensic trace of why a specific vehicle was throttled last night — the building HVAC spiked, the AI redistributed the budget, zero vehicles were stranded.

**[Click "Rebates" in the sidebar]**

> We also surface money operators are leaving on the table. Seven rebate programs, $154,000 identified, $79,000 already claimed.

**[Click "Site View" in the sidebar — pause a moment for the 3D scene to load]**

> And here's the physical depot in 3D — live charger status, energy particles flowing from the main panel, and a demand gauge showing our real-time headroom.

**[Click "Reports" in the sidebar]**

> Ninety days of real data. 140,000 kilowatt-hours delivered. $141,000 in demand charges avoided at one site alone.

**[Hold on the dashboard or landing page for the close]**

> AeroCharge is fully functional today — live AI allocation, 3D visualization, rebate tracking, and historical analytics. We built it for the fleet operators paying demand charges they shouldn't have to pay. Thank you."
