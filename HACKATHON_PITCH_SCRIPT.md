**Target:** ~2 minutes | **Style:** Live pitch with exact navigation

### Script with Directions

**[0:00–0:12 — HOOK]**

> "Fleet operators across Texas burn $50,000 a month on demand charges — not electricity, penalties. Eight chargers at full rate blow past a 500-kilowatt limit. We built AeroCharge to fix that."

---

**[0:12–0:35 — ORIGINAL IDEA]**

> "AeroCharge is an AI agent that runs every five seconds. It reads base load, battery state, and departure times — allocates power in real time — and keeps the whole site under the demand limit. Nobody else does live AI load allocation with explainability for fleet depots."

**Action:** Stay on landing page; gesture at the animated demand chart in the hero.

---

**[0:35–0:55 — WORKING MVP + 3D]**

> "Here's the live dashboard."

**Action:** Click **"Enter Demo Dashboard"** in the hero.

> "AI decisions refresh every five seconds. And here's the 3D depot — live charger status, energy flowing from the panel, demand gauge showing headroom."

**Action:** In the left sidebar, click **"Site View"** (or **"3D Site View"** on the dashboard cards). Let the 3D scene load, orbit briefly, then click a charger to show the vehicle panel.

---

**[0:55–1:20 — HARD TO BUILD]**

> "Gemini for structured allocation, heuristic fallback if the AI fails. Anomaly detection, rebate programs — $154,000 identified, $79,000 claimed."

**Action:** In the left sidebar, click **"AI Insights"**. Point at one anomaly or prediction.

**Action:** In the left sidebar, click **"Rebates"**. Briefly show the list.

---

**[1:20–1:35 — CLOSE]**

> "Reports show 90 days of data — 140,000 kilowatt-hours, $141,000 in demand charges avoided at one site. Fully functional today. We built it for fleet operators paying penalties they shouldn't. Thank you."

**Action:** In the left sidebar, click **"Reports"**. Hold on that screen for the final line.
